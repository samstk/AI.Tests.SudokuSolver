This sudoku solver can complete insane level sudoku puzzles with some processing time (a few seconds).
However, it will solve most sudoku puzzles and can be used to assist solving any level
sudoku puzzle without any large processing time (takes a while to solve Arto Inkala's sudoku puzzle)

Mainly created for educational purposes, as extension to the SSDK.AI package.

For the moment (8/11/2023), the CSP class in SSDK.AI which solves the problem is not the most efficient, and modifications
to the Solve method may drastically decrease processing time.
